## Git Workflow and Branching Strategy

### Simplified Git Flow for Solo Development

**Git Workflow Process with Performance Metrics**

| Workflow Stage | Time Investment | Complexity Level | Error Risk | Automation Level |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Feature Branch Creation** | 30 seconds | Low | Minimal | Manual |
| **Development/Testing** | 1-4 hours | Medium | Low | Partial |
| **Local Validation** | 5 minutes | Low | Low | Automated |
| **Commit and Push** | 2 minutes | Low | Minimal | Manual |
| **GitHub Pages Deploy** | 1-3 minutes | None | Very low | Fully automated |
| **Production Verification** | 2 minutes | Low | Low | Manual |

**Branch Management Strategy:**
- **Main Branch**: Always production-ready code
- **Feature Branches**: Short-lived (1-3 days maximum)
- **Direct Merges**: No pull request overhead for solo development
- **Linear History**: Optional, merge commits provide context

### Commit Message Convention
**Structured Commit Message Format:**
Use conventional commit format for clear change tracking:

**Commit Type Examples:**
- **feat**: add blog post filtering by multiple categories
- **fix**: resolve mobile layout issues in blog grid
- **docs**: update platform blueprint with monitoring strategy
- **style**: improve organization and variable naming
- **refactor**: extract common patterns to reusable modules
- **test**: add accessibility validation to development workflow
- **chore**: update development tooling configuration

**Real Development Examples:**
- **feat(blog)**: implement dual-dimension filtering system
- **fix(css)**: resolve mobile scrolling issues on iOS Safari
- **docs(platform)**: complete scalability and monitoring blueprints

### Advanced Git Workflow (Future Team Development)
**Feature Branch Workflow for Team Collaboration:**
When transitioning to team development, implement structured workflows:

**Git Flow Implementation:**
- Initialize git-flow for structured branching
**Hotfix Workflow:**
- Create hotfix branches for critical production issues
- Apply fixes with minimal change scope
- Complete hotfix process with immediate deployment

## Continuous Integration Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration
**Continuous Integration Trigger Setup:**
- **Push Events**: Monitor main and develop branch changes
- **Pull Request Events**: Validate changes before merge
- **Workflow File**: Located in .github/workflows/ci.yml

**Automated Quality Assurance Pipeline:**

**Quality Checks Job Configuration:**
- **Environment**: Ubuntu latest with Node.js 20
- **Code Checkout**: Latest version with dependency caching
- **Dependency Management**: Clean install for consistent builds
- **CSS Validation**: Stylelint for CSS quality and standards

### Pre-commit Hooks Implementation
**Pre-commit Validation Script:**
Executable script located in .git/hooks/pre-commit that performs:

**File Size Validation:**
- Check for large files before commit
- Prevent files larger than 1MB from being committed
- Display file size warnings for optimization

**Code Quality Checks:**
- Lint staged CSS files using Stylelint
- Validate staged JavaScript files using ESLint
- Check HTML markup validation using html-validate
- Only process files that are actually staged for commit

**Process Flow:**
1. Echo progress messages for user feedback
2. Run checks on staged files only
3. Exit with error code if any check fails
4. Allow commit to proceed if all checks pass

## Deployment Pipeline

### GitHub Pages Automatic Deployment
**GitHub Pages Configuration:**
- **Source**: Deploy from main branch
- **Folder**: Root directory (/)
- **Build Process**: No Jekyll processing due to no configuration file

**Validation Results:**
- Use Promise.allSettled for comprehensive testing
- Report all failures with specific error messages
- Return boolean success/failure status
- Log detailed validation progress


## Code Quality Management


### Performance Budget Enforcement

Performance budget configuration defines resource size limits for document, stylesheet, script, image, and font files. Timing budgets establish maximum thresholds for first contentful paint, largest contentful paint, and interactivity metrics.

**Performance Budget Configuration:**
- **First Contentful Paint**: Budget of 1500 milliseconds
- **Speed Index**: Budget of 2500 milliseconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: Budget of 2500 milliseconds  
- **Total Blocking Time**: Budget of 200 milliseconds
- **Time to Interactive**: Budget of 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: Budget of 0.1 CLS score

## Documentation and Knowledge Management

### Documentation as Code Strategy
**Documentation Structure:**
- **README.md**: Project overview and quick start guide
- **CLAUDE.md**: Development guidance and AI interaction patterns
- **platform-blueprint/**: Technical architecture documentation
- **req-and-design/**: Requirements and design documentation
- **docs/** (Future): Extended documentation for complex features

**Documentation Standards:**
1. All documentation written in Markdown format for universal compatibility
2. Version controlled alongside code for consistency
3. Updated with every significant change or feature addition
4. Examples include working references and practical guidance
5. Architecture decisions recorded using ADR format

### Architecture Decision Records Framework
**ADR Implementation:**
Document significant architectural decisions with structured format:

**Decision Record Structure:**
- **Status**: Current state (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated)
- **Context**: Background and driving factors
The site requires basic interactivity (filtering, sorting) and could be built with a JavaScript framework or vanilla JavaScript.

## Decision
Use vanilla JavaScript without any framework.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Zero dependencies and build complexity
- Instant development feedback
- Smaller bundle size
- Universal browser compatibility
- Easy onboarding for any developer

### Negative:
- Manual DOM manipulation required
- No component reusability patterns
- Limited state management options
- More verbose code for complex interactions

## Alternatives Considered
- React: Too heavy for current needs
- Vue: Still requires build process
- Alpine.js: Adds dependency without significant benefit
## Release Management

### Semantic Versioning Strategy

Version numbering follows MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format for release management. Major versions indicate breaking changes like complete redesigns or URL structure changes. Minor versions introduce new features such as additional blog filtering options or enhanced functionality.
# - Enhanced functionality

# PATCH (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes
# - CSS fixes
# - JavaScript bug fixes
# - Content updates

# Current version: 1.0.0 (Initial release)
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release with blog filtering"
git push origin v1.0.0

### Release Checklist

Release checklist documentation ensures comprehensive testing and deployment verification for each version release.

**Example ADR Topics:**
